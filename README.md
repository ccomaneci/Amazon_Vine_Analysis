# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

##Overview
### For this project we analyzed the reviews from the Amazon Vine program. We did this to help determine if we could find bias favoritism when it comes to memebers and non-members when rating products.

##Results
### We used PySpark to help us pull in the data we wanted to analyzed from Amazon
